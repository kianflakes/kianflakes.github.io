        <h3>Born in Barcelona, Spain. I entered ECIB film school in 2018 where I earned a diploma in Cinematography. <br><br>Though my time there I developed a passion for 1st and 2nd ACing, I was passionate about being around cameras, working along side the DP to bring creative and technical <br>solutions to his camera needs as well as assisting other focus pullers, lifting as many burdens off their shoulders and being as efficient as possible.<br><br> I've done work in music videos, commercials and some student short films, I look forward to working in features and documentaries in the future as I keep learning the art <br>of focus pulling and 2nd Assisting.</h3>
